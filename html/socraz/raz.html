<h1 id="section">2025</h1>
<p>These are Notes and ideas for debate and collaboration.</p>
<p>Regarding all our assets be it in Antsirabe, Vatomandry, … there will
be three entities to consider in the future. A familly Holding. One or
many Operational business entities, and even perhaps a family Trust.</p>
<p>The coming year 2025, we are focusing on the <em>Operation</em> part
(Truck, Purchase/sale local products for the domestic market).</p>
<p>DDB’s proposal about profit sharing is directly applicable.</p>
<article>
<p>Let PBR (Good performance bonus) be a percentage determined on a
fraction of the net profit of a member company (Operating company) of
the yet to be established Family Holding..</p>
<ul>
<li>The Core [Le noyau : Cadre n1(Jean Yves, Chris)] 60%PBR ;</li>
<li>The Circle [Cadre n2 (Eric, Zefa)] 25%PBR ;</li>
<li>The Staff [Les Employés déjà salariés : chauffeur et convoyeurs]
10%PBR ;</li>
<li>The Chairman [Fonds de solidarité géré par Dadabe] 5%</li>
</ul>
</article>
<p>Tentitatively we shall set the PBR for each annual quarter (Q1
{Jan-Mar}, Q2 {Apr-Jun}, …)</p>
<p>That is the next PBR or profit sharing will take place the last week
of March 2025.</p>

<p>Information about the three entities to consider.</p>
<h1 id="holding">Holding</h1>
<h4>
Estate management and asset protection.
</h4>
<p>A family holding company is an LLC (SARL) or a limited partnership
that’s established to hold assets for the benefit of family members.</p>
<p>A family holding company is a powerful financial structure that
allows families to manage their wealth and business interests
collectively.</p>
<p>This type of organization owns controlling stakes in various
subsidiaries, providing a centralized approach to asset management and
investment strategies.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of a Family Holding Company?</p>
<p>Family holding companies offer numerous benefits, including enhanced
control over family assets, streamlined wealth transfer, and potential
tax advantages.</p>
<p>One goal of this structure is to ensure that assets can be shifted
out of your estate and into the hands of future generations or trusts
for their benefit. Instead of transferring an asset directly into the
hands of the next generation, you can combine family-owned assets into
the family holding company and use it as a centralized way of managing
the family’s wealth. Then you can transfer shares or a percentage
interest in the family holding company that owns the assets to the next
generation or trusts for their benefit.</p>
<p>Benefits</p>
<p>Improved Cooperation. A family holding company brings about family
cooperation through managing your assets together in the most efficient
way possible.</p>
<p>Another significant benefit of owning the assets in a properly
structured family holding company is that in many states, your creditors
will not be able to force the holding company to liquidate its assets or
make distributions to you if they have obtained a court judgment against
you or other members of the holding company.</p>

<pre><code>Purpose:

Holding Company: A holding company is a business entity created primarily to own and manage investments in other companies, assets, or securities. Its main purpose is to hold, control, and manage these investments, and it usually does not engage in the production, distribution, or sale of products or services directly.

Business Activities:

Holding Company: The primary activities of a holding company include acquiring, managing, and divesting ownership stakes in other companies, and collecting dividends or capital gains from these investments. A holding company may provide support services like management, financial, or legal guidance to its subsidiaries, but it generally does not engage in direct business operations.

Structure:

Holding Company: A holding company may own shares in multiple subsidiary companies, each operating independently or as part of a larger corporate structure. The holding company may also have an ownership stake in other holding companies.

Liability:

Holding Company: By separating the holding company from its operational subsidiaries, the holding company can often limit its liability exposure. If a subsidiary faces legal or financial issues, the holding company&#39;s assets may be protected from these liabilities, depending on the jurisdiction and corporate structure.

Financial Performance:

Holding Company: The financial performance of a holding company is primarily derived from the performance of its subsidiary companies and investments. The holding company&#39;s revenues usually come from dividends, interest, and capital gains from its holdings.</code></pre>
<h1 id="operational">Operational</h1>
<h4>
The “real” business
</h4>
<p>An operating company is responsible for the day-to-day management of
the business.</p>
<p>It is often the subsidiary of the holding company.</p>
<p>A holding company owns a company’s assets (such as intellectual
property, stock and equipment used by the operating company, real
estate).</p>
<pre><code>Purpose:

Operational Company: An operational company, also known as an operating company, is a business entity that actively participates in the production, distribution, or sale of goods and services. It is involved in the day-to-day operations and management of its business.

Business Activities:

Operational Company: An operational company&#39;s activities encompass a wide range of functions related to the production and delivery of goods and services. This includes marketing, sales, research and development, manufacturing, and customer service, among others.

Structure:

Operational Company: An operational company typically has its own organizational structure and management team, focused on executing the company&#39;s business strategy and operations.

Liability:

Operational Company: An operational company is directly responsible for its actions and the consequences thereof. This means that it may be held liable for any legal or financial issues that arise from its operations.

Financial Performance:

Operational Company: The financial performance of an operational company is determined by its success in generating revenues from its core business activities, such as selling products or services</code></pre>
<h1 id="family-trust">Family Trust</h1>
<h4>
Legacy and Future Generations
</h4>
<p>Trusts are used to manage estate taxes, shelter assets from creditors
and pass on wealth to future generations. A family trust is a specific
type of trust that families can use to create a financial legacy for
years to come.</p>
<p>A family trust ensures that your assets are managed according to your
wishes on behalf of your beneficiaries.</p>
<p>At the core of a family trust, there are three parties: a grantor, a
trustee and the beneficiaries. The grantor is the person who makes the
trust and transfers their assets into it. The trustee is the person who
manages the assets in the trust on behalf of the beneficiaries. The
beneficiaries are the individuals who receive some type of financial
benefit from the trust, similar to a beneficiary for a life insurance
policy.</p>
<p>As you might expect, a family trust lists your family members as the
beneficiaries. That means your children, grandchildren, siblings, aunts
and uncles, cousins or any other family members can be a beneficiary.
Family trusts can also include spouses.</p>
A family trust is something you might consider using if you want to keep
your wealth in the family.
