#### Perseverance: relentless tenacity

The Tide.   

Sometimes low, sometimes high.  
May be Strong, may be shy.  

May give-in, but not give-up.  
Be retracted yet buildup.  

Stand mighty yet foamless.  
Be humble yet peerless.  

Formless, still,  
yet still ...  

The Tide.  


#### Title

Have a purpose. Don't cling to it.  
Don't resist obstacles. Flow with it.  
Adapt, retarget or reboot. Grow with it.  
Untatered to results, through the process  
full growth is possible.  

Have a Purpose. Dont force it.  
Dont cling to it.  

Have Goals. Don't resist obstacles  
Flow with it.  

Adapt, Retarget or Reboot  
Grow from the process  
non-attached to the result.

39. Generation after generation
we all bring our contribution
and cheer the edification
of artificial division.
This we call culture.
Our idea of past, present and future.
Our burden to carry, our duty to nurture.
However, how deep de divide remains up to us!

For it's just a matter of time,

```
Embracing comfort,
dances in my head.
Urging to depart,
my taking for granted ...
The blissfull feeling;
that of your being
friend, accomplice, wife
in our journey of life.
```

#### Of Fools and Love

```
Only fools rely solely on Love
as their mate in married life.
For love dwindles and rekindles
akin to a fire that feed that passion.
Loyalty to the partnership is the key agent
overtime, that binds two as one.

to be what they are not.

So easy the trek, escapade into the future,

What kind of map is it, that traces the path travelled
but never the trail back?
Life's road map.

Riding the wave of time,
Destination nowhere.
Feel the relentless tide,
Pulling deeper into the sea.

Forever captive of the past,
without hope to match,
the compfort of ... home.

However great, `tradition` is not static.
For culture is just a circumstantial expression
