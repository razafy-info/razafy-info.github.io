## J'observe 🧐, j'analyse 🤔, je décide💡 et je me lance

Psychologists and neuroscientists have now identified some of the common mental processes 
that mark out elite athletes such as Williams. 
And one of the most intriguing aspects appears to be a phenomenon 
known as the “quiet eye” – a kind of enhanced visual perception 
that allows the athlete to eliminate any distractions 
as they plan their next move. 

Intriguingly, quiet eye appears to be particularly important at times of stress, 
preventing the athlete from ‘choking’ at moments of high pressure. 
It may even lead to the mysterious ‘flow state’.

It’s not just budding sportsmen and sportswomen who should take note. 
The same laser-sharp focus can help doctors maintain their focus 
as they perform keyhole surgery, and it is of increasing interest to the military.

“There is a small window of opportunity for the motor system 
to receive information from the eyes,” explains Sam Vine at the University of Exeter. 
“And experts have found a better way to optimise that window and to keep that window, 
which helps their movements to be really accurate and really precise.”


...
the better the player (as measured by their golfing handicap) 
the longer and steadier their gaze on the ball just before, 
and then during, their strike. 
Novices, by contrast, tended to shift their focus between different areas of the scene, 
with each fixation lasting for shorter periods of time. 

The finding was also at odds with the equally prevalent assumption that expertise 
comes from more rapid mental processing. 
According Vickers’ results, 
the expert athlete actually slowed down their thinking at the crucial moment.

The quiet eye has since been observed in many other sports, 
including basketball, volleyball, football, tennis, archery, and ice hockey. 
Needless to say, the exact location of the gaze depends on the task in question

In each case, a steadier final fixation, 
just before the critical moment, 
marks out the expert athlete, 
who hold their gaze for 62 percent longer than novices. 

Crucially, the differences in this dwell time of the quiet eye 
don’t just predict the overall differences between elite and novice players; 
fluctuations in the onset and duration of the quiet eye 
can also explain lapses in the athlete’s individual performance, 
which would again reaffirm the idea that it is itself 
a critical part of the mental processes. 

...
the quiet eye can be taught, however. 
become more aware of their gaze as they practiced ‘free throws’. 

Given these striking results, the scientists have now started considering applications beyond elite sports.

quiet eye training can help children with coordination problems improve their physical abilities, 
contradicting a commonly held belief that they instead suffered from some problem 
with the motor system itself. 
The team are also conducting some (currently classified) research with the military. 

the quiet eye allows you to “soak in all the information from the object in question” 
which “helps you to produce the best motor response.”

And the very latest research would suggest that this period of focus is especially
crucial in high-stakes situations, preventing the athlete from ‘choking.’

... undergone quiet eye training: they managed to set the negative thoughts 
to one side and maintain a high level of performance.

the quiet eye duration correlates with self-reported feelings of ‘flow’ 
or ‘being in the zone’ – the sensation of effortless concentration, 
in which your mind is clear of everything except the task at hand. 

The quiet eye also seems to coincide to other physiological changes 
throughout the body. The heart rate temporarily decelerates, for instance, 
and the movement of the limbs themselves become smoother. 
All of this might seem to support the idea that the quiet eye 
filters distraction and calms the mind and the body at the critical moment, 
even under stress. 

“If you are behind in a game, it’s so important to relax, 
and that’s what I do – when I’m behind in a game, 
that’s when I become most relaxed,” she added. 
“Just focus on one point at a time… 
just that sole point, 
and then the next one, 
and the next one.”
