## Personal Productivity with `alefa` 

To bridge the gap between intention and action see it as a live action, a performance.

Have a [SQUID GAME ▲●■](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game){target=_blank} mindset: Perform the activity as if your life depended on it.

Work in successive propulsive burst of energy, deepwork, focus.

▲ Without Distraction  
● Perform the Process  
■ While in Session  

### The process

`alefa` incorporate the programming notions of mutex and int 0x80.
Acquire a exclusive lock on your attention (mutex)  
while performing a task previously defined (int 0x80).

[mutex or lock ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science))
[0x80 is a alias for `do what was previously defined`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INT_(x86_instruction)).  

The system hold in 3 points.  

- Perfom the process  
- until time is up  
- without distraction  

####  ● Perfom the process

Nothing is accomplished without actual work. Rustle up.
Here is the heart of this system: [Stacks and Heaps: A Personal Productivity Process](./stack_heap.html)

The circle `●` represents the gears of execution.

#### ■ until time is up

All things will pass, and most things are out of one's control.
But for a specific period of time choose to `do and only do` the task at end.
Nothing else matters.

The square `■` represents the time box dedicated to execution.

#### ▲ without distraction

When you do something specific, you are *on air* , *in session*, *live*  
Fully commit! At the very least your name is attached to it.

The `▲` triangle represents that single pointedness driving execution.

### Get better at practicing 0x80 with these tools

#### Aim for 3hours sessions

<p>Aim for 3 hours sessions.</p>
<p>Divide the 3 hours into work sessions</p>
<p>Take a break between sessions</p>
<p>First 20, 40, 60, 40, 20 minutes</p>
<p>then 40, 20, 60, 40, 20 minutes</p>
<p>then 60, 60, 60 minutes</p>

#### Just do

<ol><li>Pick a 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 steps Task.</li><li>Set a time to beat: 20, 40, 60 minutes.</li><li>Finish the steps before the time is up.</li></ol>

#### 4 rules

In order to accomplish 0x80 it is assumed 
one wants to do what was previously defined .

Hence some rules apply

1. It is wise to Acquire a Target First. (Be specific about your intent)  
It is unwise to just embark on a nebulous task

2. It is wise to set a timeframe.  
It is unwise to just do without a deadline

3. It is wise to guard your Actions from Distractions.  
It is unwise to give in to instant self-gratification

4. It is wise to seek feedback.  
It is unwise to take it personally.

#### ODY: A Checklist to `Remedy` inefficient use of deepwork time.

[] `O`bstacle cleared  
[] `D`istractions to avoid identified  
[] `Y`ield full attention to the *process*  

#### TMP: Create a temporary focus bubble

Until the time is up, *shift*  into session mode and "observe the doing" until flow time takes over.

##### Temporal (Do the time: Stick to it)

- Protect your Time
- Limit your Time
- Use your Time

##### Mental (Be water: Egoless nothing can stick to it)

- Let go of Feelings
- Let go of Desires
- Let go of Doubt

##### Physical (Stick-out: Fail it til you make it)

- Deliberate speed (Slow down)
- Deliberate Actions (Attend to the intent)
- Deliberate Posture (Decorium)
