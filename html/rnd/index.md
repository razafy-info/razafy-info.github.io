# Rindra Razafy

## Master's student

### About me.

I am a graduate student, under the supervision of [Adam Topaz](https://adamtopaz.com). 
My research interests lie in Algebraic Geometry, Category Theory and Combinatorics.

I was previously at the University of Waterloo where I completed my
BMATH in Pure Mathematics, and joint Combinatorics and Optimization.

I also work on formalization of mathematics in Lean and visualising
maths with Rust. You can find more of this work on my
[github: razafy-rindra](https://github.com/razafy-rindra){target="_blank"}.

### Publications

[David McKinnon, Rindra Razafy, Matthew Satriano, and Yuxuan Sun. On curves with high multiplicity on P(a,b,c) for min(a,b,c) â‰¤ 4. New York Journal of Mathematics, (2021), 1060-1084](https://nyjm.albany.edu/j/2021/27-41.html)

### Notes

Assortement of notes I've typed up. These notes still need to be edited
to fix the typos, please email me if you find some.
